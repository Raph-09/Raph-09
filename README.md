### 4. **Adversarial Machine Learning for Intrusion Detection**

This experiment was performed to determine the effectiveness of the proposed defence technique against evasion attacks. The IDS model was built using the CICIDS 2017 dataset found on open-source platforms like Kaggle.com. This dataset is chosen because it is used extensively by several researchers for conducting similar research (Usama et al. 2017; Haroon et al. 2022). The dataset was collected using the Python programming language and downloaded into a notebook environment for processing and analysis. After the dataset was prepared, it was used to train a decision tree algorithm to develop an IDS for detecting network intrusion. Three Different attacks were used to test the vulnerability and robustness of the trained decision tree model, of which the performance deteriorated greatly. The proposed defence of adversarial training with an ensemble classifier was put to the test by training the Adaboost, an ensembled technique, on the generated perturbated examples, and the model recorded improved performance on both seen and unseen perturbations.

### 10. News-Authenticity-Classification-Using-The-Source



This project aimed to predict the authenticity of news articles using the source of the articles. Basic data cleaning was performed on the dataset and exploratory data analysis techniques were used to explore the data for insights. Various language models, such as unigram, bigram, and trigram, were used to plot word clouds of the most common words in the news articles. A new feature called 'source' was created by combining the 'site_url' and 'text without stopwords' together, and this feature was preprocessed by performing tokenization, stemming, and punctuation removal. The stemmed text was converted into vectors using the TFIDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer. The vectors were passed into machine learning models: Adaboost, Naive Bayes, and Passive Aggressive Algorithm to make predictions, but there were many false positives and false negatives, indicating an imbalanced dataset. The imbalanced target variable was handled using oversampling, and the performance of the models was improved. Adaboost recorded a baseline accuracy of 85%, Naive Bayes 86%, and Passive Aggressive Algorithm 91%. The performance of the Passive Aggressive classifier and Adaboost model was improved after hyperparameter optimization, but Naive Bayes remained the same. The final model used for predicting the test dataset was the Passive Aggressive Algorithm. Data preprocessing and hyperparameter optimization were crucial in improving the accuracy of these models. Other models such as LSTM and BERT could also be used, but due to time constraints, these models were not used in this study
